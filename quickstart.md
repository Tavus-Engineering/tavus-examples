# Quickstart: Interactions Protocol Playground (powered by Tavus)

1. **Generate a Conversation ID**: Use the [Tavus Platform](https://platform.tavus.io/conversations/create) or the [Tavus API](https://docs.tavus.io/api-reference/conversations/create-conversation) to create a new conversation. Copy the conversation ID (but don't Join in this step!).

2. **Enter Conversation ID**: Paste the conversation ID into the input box on the playground app, then click **Join** to enter the session.

3. **Send Interactions**:
   - **Echo**: Triggers a message that the replica will speak aloud.
   - **Respond**: Sends a simulated user input, prompting a replica reply.
   - **Interrupt**: Halts the replica’s response in progress.
   - **Overwrite Context**: Updates the replica's conversational context with new information.

4. **Monitor Responses**: The app logs each event with a timestamp, showing the speaker's role, text, and visual context. Interactions are displayed in chronological order.

That’s it! You’re ready to test Interactions and observe real-time responses.
